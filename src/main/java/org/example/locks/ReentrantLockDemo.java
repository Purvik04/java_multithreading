        lock.lockInterruptibly();

        When a thread calls lock.lockInterruptibly(), it attempts to acquire the lock.
        Unlike the regular lock() method, if the thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock,
        it will throw an InterruptedException rather than waiting indefinitely.

        Internally, lock.lockInterruptibly() periodically checks the interrupt status of the thread while waiting.
        If an interrupt is detected before the lock is acquired, the method aborts and throws an exception.

        Lock Acquisition vs. Waiting:
        lock.lockInterruptibly() only makes the waiting phase interruptible.
        Once the lock is acquired, interrupts donâ€™t cause the lock to be released automatically.
